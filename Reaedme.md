ETM conversion stands for element-to-mineral conversion. It is a very powerful tool in economic geology/ mining as it allows us to convert available geochemical assay into mineral composition of the sample.

The prerequisite being that present minerals are known (through XRd, for example)

Replace ETM matrix with elemental composition of known minerals that are present in the sample in a form of matrix. The the matrix will be transformed using principle of singular value decomposition to a matrix R, so that when multiplied by a vector reprsenting a chemical assay will result mineral composition vector.
